<body>
  <p><b>I've been roamin' around</b>, always lookin' down at all I see,
    Painted faces fill the places I can't reach.
    <br>
    <em>You know that I could use somebody,
    You know that I could use somebody.</em>
    <br>
    Someone like you and all you know and how you speak,
    Countless lovers under cover of the street,
    <ol>
        <li>You know that I could use somebody,</li>
        <li>You know that I could use somebody.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <br>
    <h1>Someone like you!</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <b>Off in the night</b>, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep.
    Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat.
    <br>
    <em>I hope it's gonna make you notice,
    I hope it's gonna make you notice,</em>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Someone like me!</li>
        <li>Someone like me!</li>
        <li>Someone like me!</li>
        <li>Somebody!</li>
    </ul>
